    "The string streaming objects in C++ are very powerful, and there are many more ways that an `istringstream` can be used. We encourage you to have a look at all of the available functions in [the C++ reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/istringstream/). However, at this point you are ready for the next exercise. In this exercise, you will parse string lines from the board and store the `int`s in a vector using the `istringstream` and `push_back` methods from above. Have a careful look at the examples again, and copy paste any code you think you might need before clicking the `Next` button below."
